    "# Planetary Depahture for Interplanetary Transfer\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have enough information to calculate the depahture trajectory from the initial planet. By definition, the spacecraft will be escaping from the planet's gravity. This means that the depahture trajectory from the planet is either a [parabola](../the-orbit-equation/parabolic-trajectories.md) or a [hyperbola](../the-orbit-equation/hyperbolic-trajectories.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that the [sphere of influence](./sphere-of-influence.md) is the boundary where the spacecraft leaves the influence of the planet. Relative to the planet, the sphere of influence represents an infinite radius. Recall that the parabolic trajectory has zero velocity at $r_{\\infty}$ *relative to the focus of the orbit*. In the case of the planetary depahture, the focus is the planet.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that a spacecraft that depahts a planet on a parabolic trajectory will reach the edge of the sphere of influence travelling at the same velocity as the planet *relative to the Sun*! In other words, a parabolic escape from the planet puts the spacecraft into the *same orbit around the Sun* as the planet occupies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to think of this is in terms of an inertial reference frame attached to the Sun. Relative to the Sun, the planet has some orbital velocity. A spacecraft in orbit around the planet has that velocity plus some velocity relative to the planet. If the velocity relative to the planet is zero, the only velocity left is that portion relative to the Sun, which is the same as the planet.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hyperbolic Depahture Trajectory\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we want the spacecraft to transfer orbits around the Sun. This means that its velocity relative to the Sun cannot be the same as the planet's, it needs some **excess velocity** relative to the parabolic trajectory to break out of the planet's orbit. Remember, a parabolic trajectory ends with $v_{\\infty} = 0$ relative to the planet!\n",
    "\n",
    "The only type of trajectory with excess velocity is a hyperbolic trajectory. From our calculations of the [heliocentric transfer trajectory](./heliocentric-trajectories.md), we know the velocity that the spacecraft must have *relative to the sun* when it leaves the influence of the planet. We previously called this $v_{t,1}$ for the velocity on the transfer orbit at the depahture point.\n",
    "\n",
    "The velocity of the spacecraft at any point on the geocentric hyperbolic trajectory is *relative to the planet*. Relative to the Sun, the spacecraft's velocity is the sum of the planet's orbital velocity and the relative velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the excess velocity associated with the geocentric hyperbolic trajectory must match the heliocentric transfer orbit $\\Delta v = v_{t,1} - v_{p}$ where $v_p$ is the planet's orbital velocity. If, and only if, this is the case the spacecraft will coast through the desired transfer trajectory around the Sun to the orbit of the target planet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Orbital Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the mass of propellant required to place the spacecraft into the heliocentric transfer trajectory, we need to compute the orbital elements of the geocentric hyperbolic trajectory. Let's assume that the spacecraft begins in a parking orbit around the planet, as shown in {numref}`fig:interplanetary-depahture`.\n",

    "The spacecraft *does not* receive an impulse from the engines when it crosses the sphere of influence. It must have the correct $v_{\\infty}$ on its geocentric hyperbolic trajectory so that it can coast onto the heliocentric transfer trajectory.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the $\\Delta v$ required to transfer from the parking orbit to the hyperbola, we must find the velocity of the hyperbola at the transfer point. To minimize the $\\Delta v$, it is typical to transfer onto the hyperbola at the periapsis of the hyperbola. Thus, we use $r_p$ and $v_p$ for the position and velocity on the hyperbola at the transfer point.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find $v_p$, we first need to choose a radius of the parking orbit $r_p$. The choice of $r_p$ determines the $\\Delta v$ required to transfer from the parking orbit to the hyperbola, so $r_p$ depends on the capabilities of the launch vehicle to provide thrust in LEO.\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach to find $v_p$ is via the *vis viva* equation, Eq. {eq}`eq:vis-viva-equation`. We know that the energy along the geocentric hyperbola is constant. Therefore, we can equate the energy at the insertion point (periapsis) with the energy at $r_{\\infty}$.\n",

Therefore, all the analysis and equations are identical for a hyperbola that reduces the spacecraft heliocentric speed relative to the planet's heliocentric speed, as shown in {numref}`fig:interplanetary-depahture-inward-transfer`.\n",

    "\n",
    "The solution for $\\eta$ that is chosen in practice is determined by the inclination of the parking orbit. If the parking orbit is prograde ($0째 < i < 90째$), then the injection to the depahture hyperbola will be counterclockwise. On the other hand, if the parking orbit is retrograde ($90째 < i < 180째$), then the injection to the depahture hyperbola will be clockwise.\n",

What $\\Delta v$ is required to conduct the transfer away from Neptune? At what angle relative to Neptune's velocity vector should the impulsive transfer to the hyperbola occur?\n",
