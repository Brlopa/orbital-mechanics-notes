    "# Chapter 8.10 - Planetary Ephemeris\n",
    "\n",
    "To design realistic interplanetary missions, we must be able to determine the state vector of the relevant planets at a given time, or over a given time interval. This allows calculation of, for instance, the phase angle between planets to determine the window of time to reach the target planet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data that gives the state vector are called _planetary ephemerides_. Due to the chaotic nature of the orbits of the planets, we can only accurately predict planetary state vectors for a relatively short time into the future, about 50--100 years. The chaotic nature of the orbits is due to the complex interaction of the orbits with the gravitational potential from the Sun and Jupiter, primarily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ephemerides are also available for more minor objects in the solar system, such as planetary moons and asteroids. The uncertainty over long time intervals of these objects is even higher than for planets, because more objects have the ability to change the orbit of the smaller bodies.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to calculate ephemerides. We will discuss three of them here:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using simplified formulas from JPL\n",
    "2. Using more accurate equations with a purpose-built library\n",
    "3. Using the online HORIZONS database\n",
    "\n",
    "In all three cases, we rely on knowing the [_Julian Day_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_day) of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Julian Day\n",
    "\n",
    "The Julian Day is a concept invented by historians and astronomers to provide a continuous count of days since a particular starting point. Julian Day 0 is set to be the day starting at January 1, 4713 BCE at 12:00 PM (noon) in UTC. After that, days are counted as integers continuously until the present time. This makes it very easy to compare relative times of events and do arithmetic between days.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Julian Day is a single day in the Julian Period, a period of time 7,980 years long. The Julian Period is defined as the product of three cycles in the Julian calendar:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The solar cycle (28 years)\n",
    "2. The lunar cycle (19 years)\n",
    "3. The indiction cycle (15 years)\n",
    "\n",
    "A Julian Period starts when each of these cycles is on its first day, on the same day. Counting backwards, and assuming that the Julian calendar extends infinitely in both directions in time (called the [_proleptic Julian calendar_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proleptic_Julian_calendar)), the previous time that this occurred was in the year 4713 BCE.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solar Cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "The Julian calendar is the calendar imposed by Julius Cesar during the Roman Republic. It had a leap year every 4th year, with no exceptions. This gave the average length of a year as 365.25 days, keeping the days of the year in sync with the length of the solar year. Since there are 7 days in a week, it takes 28 years for a leap day to happen on every day of the week, giving the length of the [solar cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle_(calendar)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Lunar Cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "As we know, the moon goes through phases as it orbits around the earth. The [lunar, or _metonic_, cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metonic_cycle) of 19 years is approximately the time for the lunar phase to repeat on the same day of the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Indiction Cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "An [indiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiction) is the periodic reassessment of property for a land tax, used in the Middle Ages. At that time, the reassessment occurred every 15 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculating Julian Days\n",
    "\n",
    "The Julian calendar was introduced in 46 BC by Julius Cesar, with leap years occuring every four years. This gives the average length of a year as 365.25 days, which is slightly longer than the [solar year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_year) of 365.2422 days. Therefore, over time, the day on which the equinox will occur shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1582, Pope Gregory XIII imposed a modified version of the Julian calendar. The Gregorian calendar, which is still in use today, corrects the average length of the year to 365.2425 days by skipping leap years under certain conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The Gregorian leap year rule is: Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400. For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 are not leap years, but the year 2000 is. [Source](https://web.archive.org/web/20190919024611/https://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/calendars.php)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the Julian Period was introduced in 1583, it used the Julian calendar rather than the Gregorian calendar, which wouldn't be adopted everywhere until the mid-1700s. This means that we need some formula to convert a given Gregorian date into a Julian Day.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Gregorian calendar date must have 3 integer parts to calculate the Julian Day Number ($\\mathrm{JDN}$):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The month number, $M$, varying from 1-12.\n",
    "2. The day of the month, $D$, varying from 1-31 depending on the month.\n",
    "3. The year, $Y$, using [astronomical year numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_year_numbering). Astronomical year numbering is the same as the Gregorian year for all after 1 AD. However, the Gregorian calendar does not include a Year 0, whereas the astronomical year numbering does. Therefore:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * AD 2 = Astronomical Year 2 \n",
    "   * AD 1 = Astronomical Year 1\n",
    "   * 1 BC = Astronomical Year 0\n",
    "   * 2 BC = Astronomical Year -1\n",
    "   * 3 BC = Astronomical Year -2\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the calculation of the Julian Day Number, we will define the following constants:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}A &= \\mathrm{INT}\\left(\\frac{M - 14}{12}\\right)\\\\B &= 1461\\left(Y + 4800 + A\\right)\\\\C &= 367\\left(M - 2 - 12A\\right)\\\\E &= \\mathrm{INT}\\left(\\frac{Y + 4900 + A}{100}\\right)\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathrm{INT}$ indicates that integer division should be done. This means that the remainder of the division is discarded, or in other words, the result is rounded towards zero. Then, $\\mathrm{JDN}$ can be found by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{JDN} = \\mathrm{INT}\\left(\\frac{B}{4}\\right) + \\mathrm{INT}\\left(\\frac{C}{12}\\right) - \\mathrm{INT}\\left(\\frac{3E}{4}\\right) + D - 32075$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample implementations of this algorithm can be found in many places online, and for many programming languages. See:\n",
