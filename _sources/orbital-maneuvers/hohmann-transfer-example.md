# Example: Hohmann Transfer

The [Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_Operational_Environmental_Satellite) system encompasses a set of spacecraft to perform imaging of the earth from GEO. The most recently launched satellite is [GOES-17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOES-17), which had a launch mass of 5,192 kg.

Assume that the launch vehicle placed GOES-17 into a circular LEO with an altitude of 250 km. Determine the $\Delta v$ and propellant mass required for a Hohmann transfer orbit to GEO.
