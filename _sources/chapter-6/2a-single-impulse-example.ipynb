    "# Example: Single Impulse Orbital Change\n",
    "\n",
    "For the case of a single-impulse orbital maneuver, the initial and final orbits must intersect at some point. Then, the $\\Delta \\vector{v}$ that is needed to change from one orbit to the other is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta \\vector{v} = \\vector{v}_2 - \\vector{v}_1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the two velocities are determined at the point of intersection of the two orbits. The equation can be simplified to involve only velocity magnitudes when the velocity vectors are parallel at the point of intersection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a case where we want to deorbit a spacecraft from low Earth orbit. To deorbit a spacecraft, we need to place it in an orbit that will intersect the atmosphere. Once in the atmosphere, drag will take over and reduce the velocity to the terminal velocity. As a simplification, we will neglect the atmosphere. This means we will determine the true anomaly when the spacecraft reaches the surface of the earth, or when the orbital radius is equal to the earth's radius.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, the spacecraft is in a circular orbit at 1000 km altitude. We define the apse line pointing to the right along the $x$ axis, as usual. When the spacecraft reaches the apse line, an impulsive thrust is provided to put the spacecraft on the deorbit trajectory, which will be an ellipse. We would like the spacecraft to impact at a point 145° from the impulse point. This situation is shown in the figure below."

    "We are interested in calculating the $\\Delta v$ required to perform this maneuver. Since the impact orbit and the initial orbit intersect at one point, we can use a single impulse transfer to perform the maneuver. Therefore, the $\\Delta v$ is given by the difference in velocities at the impulse point. Since the velocity vectors are parallel for the initial and impact orbits at the impulse point, we can work entirely in magnitudes.\n",

In particular, the apogee altitude is given by the altitude of the initial orbit, and the perigee altitude is actually inside the earth. This means that the apse line of the impact orbit actually points to the _left_ on the figure above. Thus, the velocity on the impact orbit at the impulse point is actually the apogee velocity, given by:\n",
