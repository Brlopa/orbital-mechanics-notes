    "## Plotting the Lagrange Points\n",
    "\n",
    "In the nondimensional coordinates, we know that $L_4$ and $L_5$ have analytical solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}&L_4: & x^* &= \\frac{1}{2} - \\pi_2 & y^* &= \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\\\&L_5: & x^* &= \\frac{1}{2} - \\pi_2 & y^* &= -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the collinear Lagrange points do not have an analytical solution, and must be approximated numerically. To do so, we will use [`scipy.optimize.newton()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.newton.html) in Python and [`fzero`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/fzero.html) in Matlab.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for the nondimensional position of the collinear Lagrange points is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$0 = x^* - \\frac{1 - \\pi_2}{\\left\\lvert x^* + \\pi_2\\right\\rvert ^3}\\left(x^* + \\pi_2\\right) - \\frac{\\pi_2}{\\left\\lvert x^* - 1 + \\pi_2\\right\\rvert ^3}\\left(x^* - 1 + \\pi_2\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we have $f(x^*, \\pi_2)$, which for a given value of $\\pi_2$ has three roots for $x^*$. Remember from the S-curve graph that $L_2$ has positive values, between $x^* =$ 1 and about 1.25, $L_1$ is in the middle, with $x^*$ ranging from 1 to -1, and for $L_3$, the values of $x^*$ are below $-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both `scipy.optimize.newton` and `fzero` depend on having a good guess of the initial point to get to the right Lagrange point. My suggestion is to use the following initial guess range for both functions, depending on which Lagrange point you're looking for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $L_2$:\n",
    "  * Python (`scipy.optimize.newton`): `x0=1`\n",
    "  * MATLAB (`fzero`): `[1, 1.5]`\n",
    "* $L_1$:\n",
    "  * Python (`scipy.optimize.newton`): `x0=0`\n",
    "  * MATLAB (`fzero`): Either `[0, -0.5]` or `[0, 0.5]` depending on the value of $\\pi_2$\n",
    "* $L_3$:\n",
    "  * Python (`scipy.optimize.newton`): `x0=-1`\n",
    "  * MATLAB (`fzero`): `[-1, -1.5]`\n",
    "  \n",
    "For some reason, the `fzero()` in MATLAB seems much more sensitive to the initial guess value, and if you only provide a single value for the initial guess, it chooses a positive value as the second part of the interval. Thus, if the root is below your initial guess the MATLAB solver will not be able to find it."
