    "# Chapter 2.12 - Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we solve the three-body problem, subject to some restrictions. In particular:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are two primary masses, and the mass of the tertiary object is extremely small in comparison to $m_1$ and $m_2$\n",
    "2. The mass of $m_1$ is larger than $m_2$\n",
    "3. The two primary objects orbit in a circle around their center of mass\n",
    "\n",
    "Although these assumptions seem fairly restrictive, they actually represent several very important physical situations: the Earth-Moon system, as well as the orbits of many of the planets around the sun, with a man-made object as the third mass! This is called the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CRTBP or CR3BP), because the orbits are restricted to circles and the mass of the third body is restricted to be much smaller than the other two.\n",
    "\n",
    "The orbit of the moon around the earth is approximately circular, with a mean eccentricity of 0.054, and semimajor and semiminor axes of 384,400 km and 383,800 km, respectively. The center of mass of the system occurs at a distance of 4,600 km from the Earth's center, about 72% of the radius of the Earth. This data comes from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon).\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the orbits of Venus, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and Uranus around the sun all have eccentricities less than 0.06, according to the [NASA Planetary Fact Sheet](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the two-body problem, there is no general closed-form solution to this problem. Closed-form means an analytical equation we can solve. But we can construct the equations of motion to find some interesting parameters of the orbits.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Orbit of Primary Masses\n",
    "\n",
    "We first attach a non-inertial coordinate system to the barycenter of the system of $m_1$ and $m_2$, such that the $x$-axis of this coordinate system points towards $m_2$. The distance from $m_1$ to $m_2$ is $r_{12}$, which is also the radius of the circular orbit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $y$-axis of this coordinate system is in the orbital plane, and the $z$-axis is perpendicular to the orbital plane, in the same direction as the angular momentum vector. In the rotating reference frame, $m_1$ and $m_2$ appear to be stationary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inertial angular velocity is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vector{\\Omega} = \\Omega\\uvec{k}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Omega = \\frac{2\\pi}{T}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the orbital period is for a circular orbit:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\mu}}r_{12}^{3/2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Plugging this in for $\\Omega$, we find:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{r_{12}^3}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the gravitational parameter is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mu = GM = G\\left(m_1 + m_2\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we want to find the positions of the two masses relative to the barycenter. By definition, the two masses lie in the orbital plane, so their $z$-coordinate is going to be zero. Since the line that connects $m_1$ and $m_2$ goes through the barycenter, then their $y$-coordinates must be zero as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case, we only need to find the $x$-coordinates, which we can do from the equation for the center of mass:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m_1 x_1 + m_2 x_2 = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a second equation to solve for $x_1$ and $x_2$. Since $m_1$ is to the left of the center of mass, $x_1$ is negative. Then $x_2$ is the distance from $m_1$ to $m_2$ plus the distance from $m_1$ to the barycenter:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_2 = x_1 + r_{12}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we define two dimensionless ratios:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{margin}\n",
    "You might be able to remember these by noting that $\\pi_1$ has $m_1$ in the numerator, and $\\pi_2$ has $m_2$ in the numerator.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\\pi_1 &= \\frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} & \\pi_2 &= \\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and solve for $x_1$ and $x_2$ in terms of these:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}x_1 &= -\\pi_2 r_{12} & x_2 &= \\pi_1 r_{12}\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Orbit of the Tertiary Mass\n",
    "\n",
    "```{margin}\n",
    "**Note:** The book calls the much smaller mass a _secondary_ mass, whereas I prefer _tertiary_. ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)_/¯\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's add the much smaller, tertiary mass into the system. We'll use the symbol $m$ for this mass, without a subscript. We want the equation of motion, that is, Newton's second law. For that we need the acceleration, which we will derive from the position.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Position, Velocity, and Acceleration\n",
    "\n",
    "The position of the tertiary mass relative to the barycenter is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vector{r} = x\\uvec{\\imath} + y\\uvec{\\jmath} + z\\uvec{k}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The position of the tertiary mass relative to $m_1$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vector{r}_1 = \\left(x - x_1\\right)\\uvec{\\imath} + y\\uvec{\\jmath} + z\\uvec{k} = \\left(x + \\pi_2 r_{12}\\right)\\uvec{\\imath} + y\\uvec{\\jmath} + z\\uvec{k}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and finally, the position of $m$ relative to $m_2$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vector{r}_2 = \\left(x - \\pi_1 r_{12}\\right)\\uvec{\\imath} + y\\uvec{\\jmath} + z\\uvec{k}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we want the _inertial_ velocity of $m$, so we need to account for the rotating frame of reference, so:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dot{\\vector{r}} = \\vector{v}_G + \\vector{\\Omega}\\cross\\vector{r} + \\vector{v}_{\\text{rel}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\vector{v}_G$ is the absolute velocity of the barycenter and $\\vector{v}_{\\text{rel}}$ is the velocity calculated in the moving coordinate system:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vector{v}_{\\text{rel}} = \\dot{x}\\uvec{\\imath} + \\dot{y}\\uvec{\\jmath} + \\dot{z}\\uvec{k}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can find the absolute acceleration of $m$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ddot{\\vector{r}} = \\vector{a}_G + \\dot{\\vector{\\Omega}}\\cross\\vector{r} + \\vector{\\Omega}\\cross\\left(\\vector{\\Omega}\\cross\\vector{r}\\right) + 2\\vector{\\Omega}\\cross\\vector{v}_{\\text{rel}} + \\vector{a}_{\\text{rel}}$$(five-term-acceleration)\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation can be simplified because we showed that the acceleration of the barycenter is zero for the two-body problem, $\\vector{a}_G = 0$. In addition, the angular velocity is constant since the orbit is circular, so $\\dot{\\vector{\\Omega}} = 0$. Then, Eq. {eq}`five-term-acceleration` can be simplified to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ddot{\\vector{r}} = \\vector{\\Omega}\\cross\\left(\\vector{\\Omega}\\cross\\vector{r}\\right) + 2\\vector{\\Omega}\\cross\\vector{v}_{\\text{rel}} + \\vector{a}_{\\text{rel}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vector{a}_{\\text{rel}} = \\ddot{x}\\uvec{\\imath} + \\ddot{y}\\uvec{\\jmath} + \\ddot{z}\\uvec{k}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Plugging everything in and simplifying:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Newton's Second Law\n",
    "\n",
    "For the tertiary body, the forces are due to both of the other masses:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m \\ddot{\\vector{r}} = \\vector{F}_1 + \\vector{F}_2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\vector{F}_1$ is the force from $m_1$ on $m$ and $\\vector{F}_2$ is the force from $m_2$ on $m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two forces are found by Newton's law of gravitation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\\vector{F}_1 &= -G\\frac{m_1 m}{r_1^2} \\left.\\uvec{u}_r\\right)_1 = -\\frac{\\mu_1 m}{r_1^3}\\vector{r}_1 \\\\ \\vector{F}_2 &= -G\\frac{m_2 m}{r_2^2}\\left.\\uvec{u}_r\\right)_2 = -\\frac{\\mu_2 m}{r_2^3}\\vector{r}_2\\end{aligned}$$\n",

    "$$\\begin{aligned}\\mu_1 &= G m_1 & \\mu_2 &= G m_2\\end{aligned}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Dividing through by $m$, we find:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ddot{\\vector{r}} = -\\frac{\\mu_1}{r_1^3}\\vector{r}_1 - \\frac{\\mu_2}{r_2^3}\\vector{r}_2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we substitute for $\\ddot{\\vector{r}}$ and split out by components to have three scalar equations of motion for the CRTBP:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\\ddot{x} - 2\\Omega\\dot{y} - \\Omega^2 x &= -\\frac{\\mu_1}{r_1^3}\\left(x + \\pi_2 r_{12}\\right) - \\frac{\\mu_2}{r_2^3}\\left(x - \\pi_1 r_{12}\\right) \\\\ \\ddot{y} + 2\\Omega\\dot{x} - \\Omega^2 y &= -\\frac{\\mu_1}{r_1^3}y - \\frac{\\mu_2}{r_2^3}y \\\\ \\ddot{z} &= -\\frac{\\mu_1}{r_1^3}z - \\frac{\\mu_2}{r_2^3}z\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few things we can note from these equations. First, the $x$ and $y$ equations are coupled; the $x$ equation depends on $y$, and the $y$ equation depends on $x$. However, the $z$ equation is decoupled from the other two, so if $m$ starts in planar motion, it will remain there.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nondimensional Equations of Motion\n",
    "\n",
    "```{margin}\n",
    "In a later section, the book also makes these equations nondimensional, since it aids the solution of some of the Lagrange points. This section is adapted from Rubinsztejn {cite}`Rubinsztejn2018,Rubinsztejn2018a,Rubinsztejn2018b`.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's make these equations nondimensional. This offers the advantage of being general for any system we want to study, and removing the dependence on the rate of rotation of the coordinate system. We start by defining a few characteristic parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the characteristic distance will be $r_{12}$ and the characteristic mass will be $\\pi_2$, for convenience. We could choose $\\pi_1$ without loss of generality. We will also define a characteristic time:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$t^* = \\sqrt{\\frac{r_{12}^3}{G\\left(m_1 + m_2\\right)}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This characteristic time is used to generate the nondimensional time:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tau = \\frac{t}{t^*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we need to define the dimensionless position vectors. The vector from $G$ becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vector{\\rho} = \\frac{\\vector{r}}{r_{12}} = x^*\\uvec{\\imath} + y^*\\uvec{\\jmath} + z^*\\uvec{k}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x^* = x/r_{12}$, and similar for $y^*$ and $z^*$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other two position vectors, from $m_1$ and $m_2$, respectively, become:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\\vector{\\sigma} &= \\frac{\\vector{r}_1}{r_{12}} = \\left(x^* + \\pi_2\\right)\\uvec{\\imath} + y^*\\uvec{\\jmath} + z^*\\uvec{k} \\\\\\vector{\\psi} &= \\frac{\\vector{r}_2}{r_{12}} = \\left(x^* - 1 + \\pi_2\\right)\\uvec{\\imath} + y^*\\uvec{\\jmath} + z^*\\uvec{k}\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $\\pi_1 = 1 - \\pi_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making the acceleration equation nondimensional involves replacing both the $\\vector{r}$ and the $t$ terms in the $d^2\\vector{r}/dt^2$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ddot{\\vector{\\rho}} = \\frac{d^2\\vector{r}}{dt^2}\\frac{\\left(t^{*}\\right)^2}{r_{12}} = \\frac{d^2\\vector{\\rho}}{d\\tau^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Making the terms on the right hand side of Eq. {eq}`five-term-acceleration` nondimensional is also the result of multiplying by $\\left(t^*\\right)^2/r_{12}$. Note that the dimensions of $\\Omega$ are $t^{-1}$:\n",

    "\n",
    "Now we have the nondimensional inertial acceleration, and we need to make Newton's second law nondimensional:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ddot{\\vector{\\rho}} = -\\frac{1 - \\pi_2}{\\sigma^3}\\vector{\\sigma} - \\frac{\\pi_2}{\\psi^3}\\vector{\\psi}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "There are three main advantages of this formulation of the equations of motion:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The equations are independent of the two masses $m_1$ and $m_2$, depending only on their relative sizes via $\\pi_2$\n",
    "2. The equations are independent of the rate of rotation of the reference frame\n",
    "3. The equations are independent of the separation distance between $m_1$ and $m_2$, so can be used to represent any system\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lagrange Points\n",
    "\n",
    "With the equations of motion, we can determine solutions by integrating them in time. As we will see, this can be a little bit tricky, depending on the situation. We also cannot solve the equations analytically, either in the dimensional or nondimensional case.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are five equilibrium points in this system of equations that we can find. An object placed at one of the equilibrium points will, if it is not perturbed, remain at that location indefinitely. These locations are called **Lagrange Points**, although Lagrange himself called them **libration points**.\n",
    "\n",
    "By definition, the acceleration and velocity components at the Lagrange points are zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dot{x} = \\dot{y} = \\dot{z} = 0 \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad  \\ddot{x} = \\ddot{y} = \\ddot{z} = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and likewise for the nondimensional coordinates as well. Plugging these conditions in to the equations of motion, we find (taking the non-dimensional case):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}-x^* &= -\\frac{1 - \\pi_2}{\\sigma^3}\\left(x^* + \\pi_2\\right) - \\frac{\\pi_2}{\\psi^3}\\left(x^* - 1 + \\pi_2\\right) \\\\-y^* &= -\\frac{1 - \\pi_2}{\\sigma^3} y^* - \\frac{\\pi_2}{\\psi^3}y^* \\\\ 0 &= \\left(-\\frac{1 - \\pi_2}{\\sigma^3} - \\frac{\\pi_2}{\\psi^3}\\right)z^*\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last equation, for $z^*$, the terms in the parentheses are both greater than zero. Therefore, there is no way for them to cancel each other out, and the only way for the equation to be satisfied is if $z^* = 0$. Thus, the Lagrange points lie in the orbital plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we need to solve for the $x^*$ and $y^*$ coordinates of the Lagrange points. There are two conditions that we need to consider, since they end up with different solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $y^* \\neq 0$, giving the so-called **equilateral Lagrange points**\n",
    "2. $y^* = 0$, giving the so-called **collinear Lagrange points**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equilateral Lagrange Points\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the equilateral Lagrange points, we assume the $y^* \\neq 0$. Now we have 2 equations and 2 unknowns. The $y^*$ in the second equation of motion will cancel from both sides, and we end up with:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$1 = \\frac{1 - \\pi_2}{\\sigma_3} + \\frac{\\pi_2}{\\psi^3}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the equation for $x^*$ we see the $\\left(1 - \\pi_2\\right)/\\sigma^3$ term, so let's solve the $y^*$ equation for that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{1 - \\pi_2}{\\sigma^3} = 1 - \\frac{\\pi_2}{\\psi^3}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Plugging the result of $\\psi^3 = 1$ back into the simplified $y^*$ equation, we find:\n",

This means that the three collinear Lagrange points are **unstable** and an object placed at one of those points, if perturbed, will diverge from the position.\n",

    "Nonetheless, these are quite useful points for observation of the solar system. Several satellites have been placed at the $L_1$ point of the Earth-Sun system for solar observation, and the James Webb Space Telescope is planned to launch to the $L_2$ of the Earth-Sun system sometime this year.\n",

    "$L_1$ and $L_2$ in the Earth-Sun system are about 1.5 million km towards the Sun and away from the Sun, starting at the Earth, respectively. $L_3$ lies on the other side of the Sun, and has long been the predicted location of a hidden planet, since it could not be observed from Earth prior to the advent of satellite observation. Now, of course, we know there is no planet at that location.\n",

    "## The Jacobi Constant\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's return now to the graph of the potential function. The potential function represents the potential energy that the tertiary mass will have if it is located at a given $x$-$y$ point in the orbital plane. The tertiary mass will also have some velocity, $v$, with a corresponding kinetic energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the law of conservation of energy, we know that the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of the tertiary mass will be constant. The potential energy (repeated here from above) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U(x^*, y^*) = -\\frac{1 - \\pi_2}{\\sigma} - \\frac{\\pi_2}{\\psi} - \\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\left(1 - \\pi_2\\right)\\sigma^2 + \\pi_2 \\psi^2\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two terms in this equation are the gravitational potential energy due to the position of the tertiary mass relative to $m_1$ and $m_2$. The third term is the potential energy of the centrifugal force induced by the rotation of the coordinate system.\n",
    "\n",
    "In nondimensional coordinates, the mass-specific kinetic energy is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{2} \\left(v^*\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\left(\\dot{x}^*\\right)^2 + \\left(\\dot{y}^*\\right)^2\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining these equations, we find from conservation of energy:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{2} \\left(v^*\\right)^2 - \\frac{1 - \\pi_2}{\\sigma} - \\frac{\\pi_2}{\\psi} - \\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\left(1 - \\pi_2\\right)\\sigma^2 + \\pi_2 \\psi^2\\right] = C$$(jacobi-constant)\n",
    "\n",
    "The constant $C$ is called the Jacobi Constant, and represents the total energy of the tertiary mass relative to the rotating reference frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $C$ is a constant, the total energy of the tertiary mass is fixed. Consider the tertiary mass at some location $\\left(x^*_1, y^*_1)$ such that it has potential energy $U_1$. Assume first that the velocity is zero. Then, the Jacobi constant is just equal to $U_1$, and the mass cannot \"climb\" any higher out of the potential energy surface. Thus, there is a region of space where the mass cannot access because it doesn't have enough energy!\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume now that the velocity of the mass is $v^*_1$. Then the Jacobi constant is equal to the sum of the kinetic and potential energies. If the mass wants to climb up the potential energy surface, it can trade kinetic energy for potential energy. Eventually, however, the kinetic energy and the velocity will go to zero, and the mass cannot climb any higher!\n",
    "\n",
    "```{margin}\n",
    "Koon et al. {cite}`Koon2011` also refer to the area where a particle cannot enter as the **Hill's region**.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's turn this problem around. We want to know, for a given value of $C$, what regions of space will be inaccessible. Consider the tertiary mass with a certain value of $C$ and at a particular location. As the mass moves, it exchanges energy between kinetic energy (velocity) and potential energy. At some position, the $C$ will be equal to $U$, and the velocity will be (by definition) zero. Thus, the mass cannot travel any further in that direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given value of the Jacobi constant, we can calculate the contours of zero velocity positions by setting $v^* = 0$ in Eq. {eq}`jacobi-constant`:\n",
