    "# Julian Day\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Julian Day** is a concept invented by historians and astronomers to provide a continuous count of days since a particular starting point. Julian Day 0 is set to be the day starting on January 1, 4713 BC in the [proleptic Julian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proleptic_Julian_calendar) at 12:00 PM (noon) in UTC. This corresponds to November 24, 4714 BC in the [proleptic Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proleptic_Gregorian_calendar).\n",
    "\n",
    "Julian days are counted as integers continuously until the present time. This makes it very easy to compare relative times of events and do arithmetic between days.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Julian Period\n",
    "\n",
    "The Julian day is a single day in the Julian Period, a period of time 7,980 years long. The Julian Period is defined as the product of three cycles in the Julian calendar:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The solar cycle (28 years)\n",
    "2. The lunar cycle (19 years)\n",
    "3. The indiction cycle (15 years)\n",
    "\n",
    "A Julian Period starts when each of these cycles is on its first day, on the same day. Counting backwards, and assuming that the Julian calendar extends infinitely in both directions in time, the previous time that this occurred was in the year 4713 BCE.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solar Cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "The Julian calendar is the calendar imposed by Julius Cesar during the Roman Republic. It had a leap year every 4th year, with no exceptions. This gave the average length of a year as 365.25 days, keeping the days of the year roughly in sync with the length of the solar year. Since there are 7 days in a week, it takes 28 years for a leap day to happen on every day of the week, giving the length of the [solar cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle_(calendar)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Lunar Cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "As we know, the moon goes through phases as it orbits around the earth. The [lunar, or **metonic**, cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metonic_cycle) of 19 years is approximately the time for the lunar phase to repeat on the same day of the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Indiction Cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "An [indiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiction) is the periodic reassessment of property for a land tax, used in the Middle Ages. At that time, the reassessment occurred every 15 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calculating Julian Days\n",
    "\n",
    "The Julian calendar was introduced in 46 BC by Julius Cesar, with leap years occuring every four years. This gives the average length of a year as 365.25 days, which is slightly longer than the [solar year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_year) of 365.2422 days. Therefore, over time, the day on which the equinox will occur shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1582, Pope Gregory XIII imposed a modified version of the Julian calendar. The Gregorian calendar, which is still in use today, corrects the average length of the year to 365.2425 days by skipping leap years under certain conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The Gregorian leap year rule is: Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400. For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 are not leap years, but the year 2000 is. [Source](https://web.archive.org/web/20190919024611/https://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/calendars.php)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the Julian Period was introduced in 1583, it used the Julian calendar rather than the Gregorian calendar, which wouldn't be adopted everywhere until the mid-1700s. This means that we need some formula to convert a given Gregorian date into a Julian Day.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Gregorian calendar date must have 3 integer parts to calculate the Julian Day Number ($\\mathrm{JDN}$):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The month number, $M$, varying from 1-12.\n",
    "2. The day of the month, $D$, varying from 1-31 depending on the month.\n",
    "3. The year, $Y$, using [astronomical year numbering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_year_numbering). Astronomical year numbering is the same as the Gregorian year for all after 1 AD. However, the Gregorian calendar does not include a Year 0, whereas the astronomical year numbering does. Therefore:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * AD 2 = Astronomical Year 2\n",
    "   * AD 1 = Astronomical Year 1\n",
    "   * 1 BC = Astronomical Year 0\n",
    "   * 2 BC = Astronomical Year -1\n",
    "   * 3 BC = Astronomical Year -2\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the calculation of the Julian Day Number, we will define the following constants:\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{math}\n",
    ":label: eq:julian-day-constants\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "  A &= \\mathrm{INT}\\left(\\frac{M - 14}{12}\\right) \\\\\n",
    "  B &= 1461\\left(Y + 4800 + A\\right) \\\\\n",
    "  C &= 367\\left(M - 2 - 12A\\right) \\\\\n",
    "  E &= \\mathrm{INT}\\left(\\frac{Y + 4900 + A}{100}\\right)\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathrm{INT}$ indicates that integer division should be done. This means that the remainder of the division is discarded, or in other words, the result is rounded towards zero. Then, $\\mathrm{JDN}$ can be found by:\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{math}\n",
    ":label: eq:julian-day-number\n",
    "\\mathrm{JDN} = \\mathrm{INT}\\left(\\frac{B}{4}\\right) + \\mathrm{INT}\\left(\\frac{C}{12}\\right) - \\mathrm{INT}\\left(\\frac{3E}{4}\\right) + D - 32075\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample implementations of this algorithm can be found in many places online, and for many programming languages. See:\n",

    "## Julian Dates\n",
    "\n",
    "Related to the Julian Day, the **Julian Date** ($\\mathrm{JDT}$) is a decimal number that includes the Julian Day number in the whole part, and the fraction of the day towards the next Julian Day Number in the decimal. Remember that Julian Days start at 12:00 PM (noon) UTC, so 6:00 PM UTC would be JDN + 0.25 and 6:00 AM UTC would be the JDN of the previous Gregorian date + 0.75.\n",
