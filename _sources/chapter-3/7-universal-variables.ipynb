    "## The Universal Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "Since these equations are so similar, we will try to find a way to unify them, such that we can solve a single equation regardless of the type of orbit. Given the initial position and velocity of the orbiting mass, we can determine the semimajor axis of the orbit from the energy equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a = \\left(\\frac{2}{r_0} - \\frac{v_0^2}{\\mu}\\right)^{-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that for a hyperbolic orbit, $a$ will be negative from this equation, in contrast to our previous definition where $a$ was positive. This gives an easy way of determining the type of orbit before finding the eccentricity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we will define the universal variable, or universal anomaly $\\chi$, which is by definition zero at $t_0$ (the time when $\\vector{r}_0$ and $\\vector{v}_0$ are known). This is analogous to the true anomaly, which is zero on the apse line, and we previously defined $t_0$ to occur at the apse line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the universal anomaly, we can find the position and velocity of the orbiting mass at any future time via:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\\vector{r} &= \\left[1 - \\frac{\\chi^2}{r_0}C\\left(\\alpha\\chi^2\\right)\\right]\\vector{r}_0 + \\left[\\left(t - t_0\\right) - \\frac{\\chi^3}{\\sqrt{\\mu}}S\\left(\\alpha\\chi^2\\right)\\right]\\vector{v}_0\\\\\\vector{v} &= \\frac{\\chi\\sqrt{\\mu}}{r r_0}\\left[\\alpha\\chi^2S\\left(\\alpha\\chi^2\\right) - 1\\right]\\vector{r}_0 + \\left[1 - \\frac{\\chi^2}{r}C\\left(\\alpha\\chi^2\\right)\\right]\\vector{v}_0\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha = 1/a$ and we will define $C(z)$ and $S(z)$ shortly. Note that $\\alpha < 0$ for hyperbolas, $\\alpha = 0$ for parabolas ($a\\rightarrow\\infty$) and $\\alpha > 0$ for ellipses. Interestingly, this gives $\\chi$ dimensions of square root of length, such that $\\alpha\\chi^2$ is dimensionless.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a previous section, we identified the coefficients of $\\vector{r}_0$ and $\\vector{v}_0$ in similar equations as the **Lagrange coefficients**, in that case, in terms of the change of true anomaly. These equations give the Lagrange coefficients in terms of the universal anomaly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we need a way to solve for $\\chi$, the universal anomaly. We can write Kepler's equation in terms of the universal anomaly as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sqrt{\\mu}\\left(t - t_0\\right) = \\frac{r_0 \\left.v_r\\right)_0}{\\sqrt{\\mu}}\\chi^2 C\\left(\\alpha\\chi^2\\right) + \\left(1 - \\alpha r_0\\right) \\chi^3S\\left(\\alpha\\chi^2\\right) + r_0 \\chi$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Like Kepler's equation in the ellipse and hyperbola specific forms, this equation is transcendental in $\\chi$. If $\\chi$ is known, the equation can be solved for the change in time interval, $t - t_0$. If the time interval is known instead, we must use numerical techniques to solve the equation.\n",
